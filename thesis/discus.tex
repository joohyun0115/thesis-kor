Our goal is to eliminate the sequential processing due to the synchronized
timestamp counters.
To achieve our goal, this paper only focus on the eliminating the synchronized
timestamp counters.
However, although the LDU eliminate time-sensitive log by using update-side
removing, the remain logs can not apply some data structure such as stack and
queue(section x).
One mightly soulution is that combine two techniques(LDU and synchronized
timestamp counters) in order to allow this limited data structure to support.
