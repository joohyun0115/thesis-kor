To evaluate the performance of \deferu, we use well-known
three benchmarks:AIM7 Linux scalability benchmark, Exim email server in
MOSBENCH and lmbench.
We selected these three benchmarks because they are fork-intensive workloads and
exhibit high reverse mapping lock contentions.
Moreover, AIM7 benchmark has widely been used in practical area not only for testing the
Linux but also for improving the scalability. 
To evaluate \deferu for real world
applications, we use Exim which is the most popular email server.
A micro benchmark, Lmbench, has been selected to focus on Linux fork operation-intensive
fine grained evaluations.
Finally, we wanted to focus on Linux fork performance and scalability;therefore,
we selected lmbench, a micro benchmark.

%Paragraph 2: 비교 대상에 대한 설명

In order to evaluate Linux scalability, we used four different experiment
settings.
First, we used the stock Linux as the baseline reference. 
Second, we used ordered Harris lock-free list while 
we apply unordered Harris lock-free list for the third setting
(see section ~\ref{sec:implementation}). 
Finally, we used combination of unordered Harris lock-free list for anonymous mapping and
our \deferu for file mapping.
Since we cannot obtain detailed implementation of Oplog, 
we could not include comparison between \deferu and Oplog in this paper.

%Paragraph 2-1: Harris Lock free list 구현 내용에 대한 설명 
%$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

We compare our \deferu implementation to a concurrent non-blocking Harris
linked list ~\cite{Harris2001Lockfree};therefore, we implement the Harris
% linked list to Linux kernel.
The code refers from sysnchrobench~\cite{Gramoli2015Synchrobench} and
ASCYLIB~\cite{David2015ASYNCHRONIZED}, and we convert their linked list to
Linux kernel style.
Because both synchrobench and ASCYLIB leak memory, we implement additional
garbage collector for the Linux kernel using Linux's work queues and lock-less
list.

%$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
%Paragraph 2-2: Harris list의 수정 내용 설명 
%$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
In order to further improve performance, we move their ordered list to
unordered list. 
A feature of the Harris linked list is all the nodes are ordered by
their key. 
Zhang~\cite{zhang2013practical} implements a lock-free unordered list
algorithm, whose list is each insert and remove operation appends an
intermediate node at the head of the list;these approach is practically
hard to implement.
Indeed, Linux does not require contains operation because the Linux data
structures such as list, tree and hash table not depended on search key;they
depend on their unique object.
This feature can eliminates the ordered list in Harris linked list.
Therefore, we perform each insert operation appends an intermediate node at
the first node of the list;on the other hand, each remove operation searches
from head to their node.

%Paragraph 3: 운영체제 및 커널 버전 설명
%$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
We ran the three benchmarks on Linux 3.19.rc4 with stock Linux with 
the automatic NUMA balancing feature disabled because the
Harris linked list has the iteration issue~\cite{petrank2013lock}. 
All experiments were performed on a 120 core machine with 8-socket, 15-core
Intel E7-8870 chips equipped with 792 GB DDR3 DRAM.

AIM7 forks many processes, each of which concurrently runs. 
We used AIM7-multiuser, which is one of workload in AIM7.
The multiuser workload is composed of various workloads such as disk-file
operations, process creation, virtual memory operations, pipe I/O, and
arithmetic operation.
To minimize IO bottlenecks, the workload was executed with tmpfs filesystems, each
of which is 10 GB.
To increase the number of users during our experiment and show the results at the
peak user numbers, 
we used the crossover.

%$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
%Paragraph 2: 실험 결과에 대한 설명
%$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
The results for AIM7-multiuser are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:aim7}, and the
results show the throughput of AIM7-multiuser with four different settings.
Up to 60 core, the stock Linux scales linearly while serialized updates in
Linux kernel become bottlenecks. 
However, up to 120core, unordered harris list and our \deferu scale well because
these workloads can run concurrently updates and can reduce the locking
overheads due to reader-writer semaphores(\code{anon\_vma},
\code{file}).
The combination of \deferu with unordered harris list has best performance and
scalability outperforming stock Linux by 1.7x and unordered harris list by
1.1x.
While the unordered harris list has 19\% idle time(see
Table~\ref{tab:memuse}), stock Linux has 51\% idle time waiting to acquire
both \code{anon\_vma's rwsem} and \code{file's i\_mmap\_rwsem}.
We can notice that although \deferu has 23\% idle time, the throughput is higher than
unordered harris list.
In this benchmark, the ordered harris list has the lowest performance and
scalability because their \code{CAS} fails frequently.

To measure the performance of Exim, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:exim}, we
used default value of MOSBENCH to use tmpfs for
spool files, log files, and user mail files.
Clients run on the same machine and each client sends to a different user to
prevent contention on user mail file.
The Exim was bottlenecked by per-directory locks protecting file creation in
the spool directories and by forks performed on different
cores~\cite{SilasBoydWickizer2010LinuxScales48}.
Therefore, although we eliminate the fork problem, the Exim may suffer from
contention on spool directories.

%Paragraph 2:실험 결과에 대한 설명
%$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
Results shown in Figure~\ref{fig:exim} show that Exim scales well for all
methods up to 60 core but not for higher core counts.
The stock Linux shows performance degradation for more than 60 core.
Both unordered harris list
and our \deferu do not suffer from performance loss 
because they do not acquire the \code{anon\_vma}
semaphore and \code{i\_mmap} semaphore in fork.
\deferu performs better due to the fact that it uses both update-side
absorbing and lock-less list, outperforming stock Linux by 1.6x and unordered
harris list by 1.1x.
Even though we applied scalable solution, Exim shows limitation on scalability
improvement
since the main bottleneck is per-directory lock contention on spool
directories.
The unordered harris list has 31\% idle time, whereas \deferu has 37\% idle
time due to the their efficient concurrent updates.

lmbench has various workloads including process creation workload(fork,

This workload is used to measure the basic process primitives such as creating

Three methods outperform stock Linux by 2.2x at 120 cores;however, before 30
core, two harris list have lower performance due to their execution overheads.
%At 15 core, the stock Linux goes up because of the NUMA effect that accesses

While stock Linux has 90\% idle time, other methods have approximately 50\%

% AIM7, EXIM, Lmbench



% Dynamic nonblocking and lock-less data strucures(structures that access
% dynamically allocated memory that may also be freed at runtime) must typically
% rely on alternative safe memory recalamation mechanisms[COMMUNICATION of the
% ACM 2013] .

%We implemented the new deferred update algorithm in Linux 3.19.rc4 kernel, and
%our modified Linux is available as open source.
%\deferu's scheme is based on deferred processing, so it needs a garbage
%collector for delayed free.
%In order to implement the garbage collector, we use the lock-less list and a
%periodic timer(1 sec) in the Linux.

%Paragraph 2: 문제점을 해결하기 위해 Harris linked list를 적용
%We compare our \deferu implementation to a concurrent non-blocking Harris
%linked list ~\cite{Harris2001Lockfree};therefore, we implement the Harris
% linked list to Linux kernel.
%The code refers from sysnchrobench~\cite{Gramoli2015Synchrobench} and

%Linux kernel style.
%Because both synchrobench and ASCYLIB leak memory, we implement additional
%garbage collector for the Linux kernel using Linux's work queues and lock-less
%list.

%A feature of the Harris linked list is all the nodes are ordered by

%Paragraph 4: mapping은 DeferU와 Harris linked 리스트 둘 다 적용,

%To the scalability of fork, the reverse mapping's lock contention should
%be eliminated not only from file reverse mapping but also from anonymous
% reverse mapping.
%The structure of file reverse mapping is simplified relatively to the
%structure of anonymous mapping because the anonymous reverse mapping is
%entangled by their global object(\code{anon\_vma}) and their
%chain(\code{anon\_vma\_chain});therefore, we only apply \deferu to file reverse
%mapping.
